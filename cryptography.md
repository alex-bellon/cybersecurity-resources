### Diffie Hellman

<details>
  <summary>Notes</summary>

  - Encryption without padding is insecure
    - Encryption: SAEP, OAEP+
    - Signature: PSS
  - Diffie Hellman relies on:
      - Discrete log problem
      - Computational DH problem
      - Decisional DH problem
    - Use this setting for public key crypto (Cramer-Shoup) or signatures (Schnorr, DSA). Mostly used for DH though.
    - Really for this setting you just need a group G = <G> of prime order q when DDH problem is hard
    - Can also get this structure from the group of points of an elliptic curve
      - Advantages
        - Much smaller parameters
        - Much more efficient operations
        - Picking parameters is easier and less error-prone
      - Modern protocols use
        - ECDH for key exchange
        - ECDSA, RSA (legacy) for signatures
  - Mod p, every invertible element has order dividing p-1 (with operation multiplication)
</details>

### RSA
<details>
  <summary>Notes</summary>

  #### keyGen
  - pick primes p, q
  - set N = pq
  - set e = 65537
  - compute d s.t. e * d ≡ 1 mod (p - 1)(q - 1)

  #### RSA function
  - f: (**Z**/N**Z**)<sup>x</sup> -> (**Z**/N**Z**)<sup>x</sup>
  - f: x -> x<sup>e</sup> mod N
  - f<sup>-1</sup>: y -> y<sup>d</sup> mod N

  #### Hard problems
  - **Factoring**: given N, find p and q
  - **RSA problem**: given N, e, y, find x s.t.x<sup>e</sup> = y

  #### Signatures from RSA
  - **KeyGen**: pubkey = (N, e), seckey = d
  - **Sign M**: σ = [Pack(M)]<sup>d</sup> mod N, Pack in (**Z**/N**Z**)<sup>x</sup>
  - **Verify**: σ<sup>e</sup> ≡ Pack(M) mod N

  #### Encryption from RSA
  k <- AE keyspace<br>
  c = E Pack(k)<sup>e</sup> mod N

  **Decrypt**: E Unpack(c<sup>d</sup> mod N) to get x
